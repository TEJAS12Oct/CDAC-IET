	Software Testing:
				Zero Defect product (




STLC Phases:

1.Requirement Analysis
	Activities:
		.Identify types of tests to be performed.
		Gather details about testing priorities and focus.
		Identify test environment details where testing is supposed to be carried out. 
		Automation Testing is really required
	outcome:
		RTM document(Requirements Traceability Martrix)
		Report for Automation testing need
								
2.Test Planning
	Activities:
		1.Preparation of test plan/strategy document for various types of testing
		2.Test tool selection
		3.Test effort estimation
		4.Resource planning and determining roles and responsibilities.
		5.Training requirement
	 outcome:
		 Test plan / startegy Document
		 Estimation 
		
3.Test case development
	Activities:
		1.Create test cases, automation scripts (if applicable)
		2.Review and baseline test cases and scripts
		3.Create test data (If Test Environment is available)
	outcome:
		Testcase
		Test data
						
			
4.Test Environment setup
	  Activity
		1.Understand the required architecture, environment set-up and prepare hardware 
		   							  and software requirement list for the Test Environment.
		2.Setup Enviornment and as well test data
		3.Test Exeuction pre Acitivities.
	outcome:
		report of readiness of enivornment Check List
		Test Result;
						
5.Test Execution:
	Activities:
		1.Execute tests as per plan
		2.Document test results, and log defects for failed cases
		3.Map defects to test cases in RTM
		4.Retest the Defect fixes
		5.Track the defects to closure				
	outcome:
		test execution status
						
6.Test Cycle closure
	Activities:
		1.Evaluate cycle completion criteria based on Time, Test coverage, Cost,Software,Critical Business Objectives, Quality
		2.Prepare test metrics based on the above parameters.
		3.Document the learning out of the project
		4.Prepare Test closure report
		5.Qualitative and quantitative reporting of quality of the work product to the customer.
		6.Test result analysis to find out the defect distribution by type and severity.
