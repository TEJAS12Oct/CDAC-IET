Test Plan::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Created and maintained by Test manager.





Test Case::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


Use Case:----------OOAD UML
	defined module of a system
		Product Catalog--------Collective functionality as one unit
									Product list----------------------------------------------------------Test Case
								        Product Details-------------------------------------------------------Test Case
									New Product Addition--------------------------------------------------Test Case
									Updating exting Product Details
									Removing product from catalog due to stock unavailable
		Shopping Cart
		Membership & Roles Management--------------------------

									Role assignment to User
									Setting permissions level for particular Role
									Adding or Removing Roles for registerd user.
									
		OrderProcessing
		Shipment ( Delivery)
		Customer Relationship management



Examples of Test Cases:
1.Check result on entering valid user ID and Password
2.Check result on entering invalid user id and Password.
3.Check response when user ID is empty & Login button is perssed.
etc.



Basic Testing:
		1.Mannual Testing------------------------Human being test software-----------------Best Testing  mannual Testing
		2.Automation Testing:--------------------Programs , tools test  software


Amazon company:

TCO: Total Cost of Ownership


Kaizen:--------------------------Continous Improvement
TQM:Total Quality Management

TDD ( Test Driven Development)

Define User STories:
		for user stories Define Test Cases
		For test Cases write unit Tests
		Give Unit Test to Developers
		Ask Developers to write code which will pass those unit Test
